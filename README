HOW TO COMPILE THE AGENT
========================

1/ Fetch and compile third party libraries
------------------------------------------
Boost and wxwidgets take quite a lot of time.

  cd ..../diveboard-agent
  cd 3d-party
  ./mac-build-divecomputer.sh
  ./mac-build-libconfig.sh
  ./mac-build-rapidjson.sh
  ./mac-build-boost.sh
  ./mac-build-wxwidgets.sh


2/ Create build directory and build using Makefile
-------------------------------------------------
Tested so far on Mac only

  cd ..../diveboard-agent
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make


3/ Check the built binaries
---------------------------
Mac : The binaries are in build/bin


4/ Package the result
---------------------

HOW TO BUILD ON WINDOWS
1) Preparations:
  Install MinGW. 
  Install Cmake. 
  Checkout project not to much in the depth of directory structure. Msys do not like to long paths. It is good to avoid spaces in the path also. 
2 Building libraries:
  Run MinGW shell. 
  cd <project root>/3d-party.
  2.1 Building Boost 
    Run MinGW shell
    cd <project root>/3d-party
    ./win-build-boost.sh
    it will run Windows cmd. Execute command int it and then exit
      bootstrap.bat mingw
      exit    
  2.2 Building other libraries   
    run build_win*.sh scripts one by one. 
3 Generating makefiles:
  Run MinGW shell. 
  cd <project root> 
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" ../
4 Building.
  Run MinGW shell. 
  cd <project root>/build
  make.
